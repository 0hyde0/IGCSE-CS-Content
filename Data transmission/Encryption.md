# Chapter 2.3: Encryption

Objectives

```
Understand the need for and purpose of encryption when transmitting data
Understand how data is encrypted using symmetric and asymmetric encryption
```

## Secrets

The sole reason for the existance of encryption, is to make data unreadable. 
Encryption involves ``scrambling data`` before being transmitted, 
which helpts it to be protected against unauthorised access as the scrambled data is unreadable.

There are two main methods of encryption, ``symmetric`` and ``asymmetric``.

## One or two keys?

``Symmetric encryption`` involves encrypting and decrypting data with only a single key. 
An example of a symmetric encryption algorithm would be AES-256.

``Asymmetric encryption`` is a little different. 
It involves encrypting data with a key and decrypting it with another. 
The ``public key`` would be the one anyone can use to encrypt any data, 
and the ``private key`` is the other key that can only decrypt the data 
encrypted with the public key.
