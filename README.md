These are just textbook-like notes that I made before my exam day on the 17th of October 2024.

Yes, I studied the syllabus in ONE MONTH and took the exam, stupid of me, I know.

And special thanks to Save My Exams (and among other sites which I already have forgotten) for some references because unfortunately the syllabus is too confusing.

Note: Some of the information might be compeltely wrong because of my bad English (ありがと、日本語！) and my completely wrecked brain that completely processes information on the wrong direction.
