These are just textbook-like notes that I made before my exam day on the 17th and the 21st of October 2024.

Yes, I studied the syllabus in ONE MONTH and took the exam, stupid of me, I know.

And special thanks to Save My Exams and ZNotes (and among other sites which I already have forgotten) for some references because unfortunately the syllabus is too confusing and semi-isolated from sources on the internet.

Note: Some of the content might be compeltely wrong because of my bad English (ありがとう、日本語！) and my completely wrecked brain that completely processes information on the wrong direction.
