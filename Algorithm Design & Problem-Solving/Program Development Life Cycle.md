# Chapter 7.1: Program Development Life Cycle

Objectives
```
Understand the program development life cycle: analysis, design, coding and testing

## Think, think!

The reason we develop software, is to develop a solution for a problem that we have. We developed operating systems to make use of bare metal hardware, and we make mobile apps alternative for web apps to make user experience a bit more simplified.

When we make a program, however, we have to identify the problem's ``requirements`` by ``analysing`` it, by using abstraction (i.e., removing unimportant details and focusing on the important points required for the solution) and ``decomposing`` the problem into smaller parts you can manage to analyse. This is called the ``analysis`` stage.

The ``design`` stage, the developer is involved to use methods to ``come up with a solution``, designed and documented in ``pseudocode, flowchart or structure diagrams``. At this stage, the developer should also clearly understand how the task should be completed and the methods to perform each task and how they will work together.

Next comes the fun part, ``coding`` ("yay")! The program is developed according to the designed solution. They will ``write code`` for modules of the program in a suitable programming language. To ensure that each module functions as intended, they are ``tested iteratively`` to ensure any errors or crashes are resolved if one exists. This will also apply when new modules are created and changed in order for no errors between interactions of each of the modules.

The last stage is the ``testing`` stage, where the ``program code is tested`` with various ``testing data`` multiple times in order to identify any underlying issues or errors that may be present. This aims to verify the overall health of the program by making sure they work as intended.

## Child of a Child

A computer system, consists of what's called a sub-system, a smaller part of the computer system that works together with others to make a computer system functional. For example, a car will only work properly when there's an engine, wheels, and breaks. These sub-systems can also be divided further into more sub-systems. An example of the 5 main sub-systems is shown below.

| CPU                --| Memory                              | Stoage                                   | Input Devices                | Output Devices                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Execute instructions | Volatile storage for temporary data |  Non-volatile storage for permanent data | Allows for input from a user | Process output from computer based on usage |

The CPU also has sub-systems, such as the control unit and arithmetic logic unit.

Some advantages of sub-systems is for the ease of troubleshooting potential errors in a computer system. This also makes it easier to isolate a sub-system and allow further testing to easily identify issues and resolve them. Developing software relies on sub-systems for an efficient operation. This also requires for the developers to have a clear picture of how to program the sub-system.
